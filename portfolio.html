            <p>You are stuck in a never ending hop, until you reach to the end. I implemented the y cordinate of the sprite as your score.
            The randomize happens during the making of every stage and everytime an enemy spawn. As you beat a stage there will be more enemy
            that will be generate depending on the stage you are at. You can lose by touching the enemy or falling to the bottom of the game. To 
            win you will need to reach to the top of the game ten time. The reason I made the game is because I was finding a way in order to make
            a spite jump so I decided to create a game all about jumping. I was able to find a way to create a sprite to constanly jump and shoot out
            sprite everytime but I understand the concept of cloning and making them having their own cordination. If I had more tiem i would be able 
            to implement an attack for the enemy.<br>
            <img src="images/algorithm.png"><br>
            The way that an enemy is created is simply because algorithm. The computer does all the math so I don't have to write every indivisual code but
            instead leave it with a variable and it will solve it for me.
